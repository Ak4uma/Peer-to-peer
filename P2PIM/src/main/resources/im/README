P2PIM: A Java based Peer to Peer Instant Messenger

READ THIS FIRST
This program was done as a demonstration for a class project. Although it is
fully funtional, there are many potential issues and risks in using it. It is
not recommended to put this into a production environment, and especially not
into an environment requiring security. If you do still wish to use it, it is
your responsibility to provide a reliable and secure network. We also made
certain assumptions about the use of multicasting on the network, so read the
source and make sure you understand those assumptions before using this on
a network that carries other multicast traffic.

Yes, we will be fixing these issues some day.

ABOUT
This program is a serverless multicast-based instant messenger. Currently it's
limited to multicasting on a private network. It has been tested on both
blackdown and Sun JREs, versions 1.3.1 and 1.4.1. Note that all users must be
using the same JRE version. 



BUILD AND RUN
An Ant build script resides in the /im directory.  It will compile all the
source, then create an executable jar file in the /dist directory at the same
level as /im.  The main class for the project is im.control.P2PIM

WHAT'S NEW

New in version 0.6:
There are a lot of changes behind the scenes. The important one is the addition 
of a user ID. This user ID has replaced the IP address as the unique client
identifier in most places, which generally means a lot more realiability.
In the future the user ID can also be changed to a public key. Encryption, 
anyone?

The one visible change is the addition of profiles. You can set your profile
before you log in by selecting Preferences under the File menu. If you change 
your profile while logged in, you'll have to log out and log back in for others 
to see it. 
Right-click another user to view their profile.
