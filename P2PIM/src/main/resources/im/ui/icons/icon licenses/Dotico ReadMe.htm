      class=coloredbold>Introduction:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> Are these Copland? 
      Not exactly. They are more of an anti-copland expression. A little 
      something to test the boundaries of iconism. They began as a few icons 
      from a defunct web site design. I wanted something with a hand drawn 
      quality and a bit of an attitude. Several iterations of said website later 
      I found these little jewels on a project backup and decided to try them as 
      icons. I think they have a lot of personality and are useful for the 
      desktop of the web.<BR><BR>This is the premier set of a (hopefully) long 
      line of collections in this style. They are crafted in Freehand, tweaked 
      in Photoshop and mastered with IconBuilder (go get it now!).<BR><BR><SPAN
