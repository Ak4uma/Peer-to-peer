This program was done as a demonstration for a class project. Although it is
fully funtional, there are many potential issues and risks in using it. It is
not recommended to put this into a production environment, and especially not
into an environment requiring security. If you do still wish to use it, it is
your responsibility to provide a reliable and secure network. We also made
certain assumptions about the use of multicasting on the network, so read the
source and make sure you understand those assumptions before using this on
a network that carries other multicast traffic.
