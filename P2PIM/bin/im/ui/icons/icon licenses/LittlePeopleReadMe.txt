		Little Icon People
		Maction HyperMedia


"Little-Icon-People" is a small collection of icons. They are saved as ResEdit Resource files with custom icons (visible in Finder).

"Little-Icon-People" are "Be-A-Friend-Ware".  If you like my icons, call a really good friend and tell him how much you like him and drop me a line what he have said.

If you want to include my Icons to a larger collection or a CD-ROM, don't forget to put this ReadMe with them.
